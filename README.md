    <p> A Story of Theatre Music and Resilience: Discovering My Light.</p>

<p> The last few months have been an emotional tornado full of twists and turns and uncertainty. My life has been a tapestry woven with threads of vulnerability resiliency and the unwavering pursuit of my passions from the depths of a personal crisis to the thrilling highs of taking the stage for the first time. </p>

<p>My life as a theater actor is centered around the power of human connection the enchanted art of storytelling and the life-changing experience of inhabiting characters that are larger than myself. But even in the crazy world of performing I have a hidden sanctuary in my band Asterismo where I give my all to the music. I get consolation expression and a feeling of community from the melodies and words. </p>

<p>The last several months though have put my resolve to the test. A personal crisis threatened to put out the fires of my passions and cast a shadow over my life. The future seemed uncertain and the world felt dark. Nevertheless I held fast to the pillars of my art throughout the tempest. Theatre rehearsals became a sanctuary a space where I could lose myself in the narratives of others finding a momentary escape from my own struggles.</p>

<p> My lyrics unfiltered emotions reflected the internal turmoil and music turned into my confidante. I found an unexpected strength through it all. Even though it was painful the crisis made me face my weaknesses and accept my fears and insecurities. It was like a crucible the intense heat creating a new resilience in me. I discovered how to rely on my network of support and ask for assistance when I most needed it. The support and affection from my friends family and fellow artists gave me comfort.</p>


<p> Then my first-ever theater production Jepoy and the Magic Circle presented itself giving me the chance to find my passion again. I had never experienced such a high degree of vulnerability in a role before so it was difficult. However it also felt freeing like I finally had a chance to voice the unfiltered feelings that had been building. The process of shedding layers of self-doubt and embracing the strength of my own voice during the rehearsals was a voyage of self-discovery. When the curtain rose on opening night I experienced an adrenaline rush and a mixture of excitement and anxiety.</p> 

<p>My vulnerabilities as well as the stage were illuminated by the bright spotlight. Nevertheless the fear left me as soon as I started talking and lost myself in the narrative to be replaced by a feeling of direction and community. I was now a storyteller an emotional conduit and a vehicle for the magic of theater not just an actor. Its been a difficult but transformative journey. Even though it was terrible the crisis made me face my problems and come out on top. My passions theatre and music became my lifelines my sources of strength and inspiration.</p> 

And Jepoy and the Magic Circle signaled a sea change a validation of my fortitude and a reminder of the ability of art to uplift heal and illuminate the human spirit. </p>

    <h2>FIRST QUARTER REFLECTION</h2>
    <p>The first quarter of ICT has been a blast for me! I've learned so much, especially about HTML coding, which has opened up a whole new world of possibilities.  This subject has been a real eye-opener, helping me discover and explore the exciting world of technology. It's allowed me to be creative, have fun, and I'm eager to see what new challenges and opportunities the next quarter brings. I'm feeling confident and excited to continue learning and growing in this field!
